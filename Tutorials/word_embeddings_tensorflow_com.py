# The intent is to firstly reorganize code into easily maintanable production-like rather than tutorial-like modules, 
# and make some quality-of-life improvements. Subsequently, the code would be expanded with better models, prediction 
# on new text-based datasets, and other functionality. Any functions useable for other projects (e.g. general text 
# sentiment recognition or video classification) will be pulled out into a shared utilities module.
